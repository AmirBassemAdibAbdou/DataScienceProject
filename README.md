## üìã Project Overview
This is my first end-to-end data science project, focused on **classification** using a Kaggle dataset. The workflow includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory analysis**, and **model evaluation** with traditional machine learning algorithms and a deep learning model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps

### **Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing & EDA**
1. **Data Inspection**  
   - Analyzed dataset structure (rows, columns, data types).  
   - Identified missing values, duplicates, and categorical attributes.  
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and filled missing values with median/mode.  
   - Binned numerical columns and encoded categorical features.  
3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Visualized distributions (boxplots, histograms, scatterplots).  
   - Generated correlation heatmaps and performed PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
   - Normalized data using `StandardScaler`.

### **Milestone 2: Model Implementation**  
1. **Algorithms Applied**  
   - Traditional ML: **KNN**, **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Tree**, **SVM**.  
   - Bonus: Deep learning model (neural network).  
2. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.  
3. **Workflow**  
   - Split data into train/test sets (`train_test_split`).  
   - Trained and compared models on test data.

## üìä Results & Insights
- **Best Performing Model**: Decision Tree/SVM achieved the highest accuracy (see code for details).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - PCA revealed distinct clusters in reduced dimensions.  
  - Strong correlations observed between specific features (via heatmap).  
  - Class distribution analysis highlighted potential data imbalances.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Data Handling: `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - ML & Preprocessing: `scikit-learn`  
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - Deep Learning: `TensorFlow`/`Keras`  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Dataset.

## üîç Conclusion
This project strengthened my skills in **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**. The comparison highlighted the strengths of tree-based models (e.g., Decision Tree) for interpretability and SVM/KNN for baseline performance. Future work could explore hyperparameter tuning or advanced neural architectures.
